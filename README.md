#StockUp

StockUp is a new app deploying in 2019 that is meant to help you create, update and monitor your grocery list while also showing you different options on where you can buy your desired item at the cheapest price.

When the user logs into the StockUp app, they're presented with several different catagories for every day shopping items (Toiliteries, Produce, General Merchandise, ect). When you click on the given catagory the user is presented a page where they can add items for that specific catagory (ex: toothpaste under the Toiliteries catagory). After the new item is submited, it displays on the page. From here the client is able to add, subtract and keep a running inventory of the quantity need for that specific item.

Throughout the app, there will be multiple links to the client's "grocery list". When the client clicks the link they're taken to their grocery list for the week that shows them exactly what they need to buy based off the inventory that they have been monitoring/adjusting throughout the week. If you hover over a given item on your list you can get price comparisons for common grocery stores to find the best price. From this page you can also see on Google Maps where the closest grocery stores are around you given your current location. For those not willing to step outside their house, there is also a link to Amazon for the item that you're needing to StockUp on.
