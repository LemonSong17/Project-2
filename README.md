#StockUp


StockUp is a new app deploying in 2019 that is meant to help you create, update and monitor your grocery list.

When the user logs into the StockUp app, they're presented with a form where they can enter what type of product they wish to purchase, the quantity of that product and what department or catagory that it would fall under. Once the user submits their item they can see the product append to their Shopping List. If the user clicks on any given item that they've added to their list they're able to see a detailed description. The user is also able to delete any of their items off of their shopping list by clicking on the red "x" to the far right of item that they're hoping to remove. 

At the bottom of the page is an accordion GUI that says "Nearby Stores". If the user clicks on it the accordian expands and the user can see a miniturized version of Google Maps. Above the map is a search form where the user can search for grocery stores or any particular store that they desire in there area or anywhere around the world for that matter. After typing in pulling up the results of whatever type of storefront the user is looking for to pick up their item, they're able to maximize the GoogleMap by clicking the expand button in the top right. From here the user is able to zoom in and out to better locate their stores, they can switch between Map and Satellite mode and they can even browse street view images by picking up and dropping the yellow man in the bottom right of the map.

Finally, right below the Nearby Stores accordion is a Recipe accordian. If the user clicks the accordian a form is expanded and presented on the sreen where users can search for different dishes. After the user presses submit they're presented with five different types of dishes based on what type of dish they typed into the form. Below each unique dish that is presented is a link to the website where the user can get further details on how to create the dish such as ingredients and cooking instructions.
